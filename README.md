This is a recipe web page using spoonacular API.

This intended function is that users will enter ingredients that they have available, and the api will return recipes that fit the ingredients listed along with any additional ingredients they may need to complete the dish.

Current problems
web app is deployed https://shimmering-fenglisu-6b303f.netlify.app/
However, I got stuck trying to enable the API, without hardcoding it, as it would be exposed on github.
Web app needs: display saved favorites.
